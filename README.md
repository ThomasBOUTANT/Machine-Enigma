# Machine Enigma_2015
Creation of my Enigma Machine in Python

How many time ?
- one week in May 2015

The "team" (I was alone):
- BOUTANT Thomas

Context of the project:
- At school and at the end of "Classes Pr√©paratoires aux Grandes Ecoles", we had to realize a personal project. I wanted to code something, since I had no experience in it and I wanted to use Python because we had had some lessons during the year (but just the basics). It was my first real experience with coding !
- Before that, I read "The Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography" from Simon SINGH and I was fascinated by cryptology ! Hence this project...
